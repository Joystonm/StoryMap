# StoryMap.ai ‚Äì Where AI Turns the Outback into Stories

StoryMap.ai is an AI-powered cultural storyteller that transforms maps into living narratives. Instead of just showing roads and pins, it invites users to explore rural Australia's heart ‚Äî its history, Indigenous heritage, climate challenges, and culture through personalized AI-generated stories, visuals, and recommendations.

Whether you're a student, tourist, researcher, or simply curious, StoryMap.ai helps you understand and appreciate the people, traditions, and struggles that make regional Australia unique.

## üåü Core Idea

Turn location data into emotional, interactive stories. By blending Groq-powered AI narratives, TasteDive cultural insights, and Tavily's local knowledge with an interactive Leaflet map, StoryMap.ai lets users explore towns, farms, and remote regions as if guided by a local storyteller.
