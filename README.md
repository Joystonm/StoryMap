# StoryMap.ai – Where AI Turns the Outback into Stories

StoryMap.ai is an AI-powered cultural storyteller that transforms maps into living narratives. Instead of just showing roads and pins, it invites users to explore rural Australia's heart — its history, Indigenous heritage, climate challenges, and culture — through personalized AI-generated stories, visuals, and recommendations.

Whether you're a student, tourist, researcher, or simply curious, StoryMap.ai helps you understand and appreciate the people, traditions, and struggles that make regional Australia unique.

## 🌟 Core Idea

Turn location data into emotional, interactive stories. By blending Groq-powered AI narratives, Qloo cultural insights, and Tavily's local knowledge with an interactive Leaflet map, StoryMap.ai lets users explore towns, farms, and remote regions as if guided by a local storyteller.
